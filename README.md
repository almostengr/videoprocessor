# Video Processor

## Purpose

Ask any YouTuber and they will tell you that creating YouTube videos is a time consuming process. 
For me, the most mundane and worse part of the process is waiting on the videos to render and uploading them
to YouTube. 

Some video editors, have a version of their software that can be ran on the server to render the video files
created. By offloading the video rendering to another machine, you can edit more videos in less time. 

Purpose of this application is to automate the video creation process. Videos that I post on both of my YouTube
channels have a predefined structure for each video. Thus they are easy to automate. When additional 
content or on screen text needs to be displayed, the automation for that particular channel is modified 
accordingly.
