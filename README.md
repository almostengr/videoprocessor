# Video Processor

## Purpose

Ask any YouTuber and they will tell you that creating YouTube videos is a time consuming process. 
For me, the most mundane and worse part of the process is waiting on the videos to render and uploading them
to YouTube. 

Some video editors, have a version of their software that can be ran on the server to render the video files
created. By offloading the video rendering to another machine, you can edit more videos in less time. 

Purpose of this application is to automate the video creation and upload process to YouTube 
for the channels that I manage.
