# Kdenlive to YouTube
 
This project is a Java application that renders videos created with Kdenlive and upload them to YouTube.

## NOTICE 

This project has been archived. This application has been replaced with Linux shell scripts that generate the 
videos. To view those scripts, visit the [ubuntu-automation](https://github.com/almostengr/ubuntu-automation)
repository.

## Purpose

Ask any YouTuber and they will tell you that creating YouTube videos is a time consuming process. 
For me, the most mundane and worse part of the process is waiting on the videos to render and uploading them
to YouTube. 

Some video editors, have a version of their software that can be ran on the server to render the video files
created. By offloading the video rendering to another machine, you can edit more videos in less time. 

I've created this Java application that will look for files in a directory and if found, will tar them and 
then render the project.
