# Kdenlive to YouTube
 
This project is a Java application that renders videos created with Kdenlive and upload them to YouTube. 

## Purpose

Ask any YouTuber and they will tell you that creating YouTube videos is a time consuming process. 
For me, the most mundane and worse part of the process is waiting on the videos to render and uploading them
to YouTube. 

Some video editors, have a version of their software that can be ran on the server to render the video files
created. By offloading the video rendering to another machine, you can edit more videos in less time. 

I've created this Java application that will look for files in a directory and if found, will tar them and 
then render the project.

## Downloading Files

The code for this project can be downloaded from
[https://github.com/almostengr/kdenlivetoyoutube](https://github.com/almostengr/kdenlivetoyoutube). Once you 
have downloaded the files, you can compile the project and create a jar file.
